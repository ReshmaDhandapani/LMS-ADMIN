            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <h3>
              Growing up, we witnessed both the struggles and growth of SME
              (Small and Medium Enterprises) entrepreneurs alike. We understood
              that the challenges of small and medium entrepreneurs are unique
              and requires a more nuanced approach which is different from what
              generally works for larger corporations. Our own aspiration to
              take up entrepreneurship coupled with burning desire to support
              SME entrepreneurs gave birth to Poornatha!
            </h3>
